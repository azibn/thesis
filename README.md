The project aims to use Bayesian nested sampling to retrieve the radial velocity parameters of faint binary stars of up to Gaia's limiting range of the 14th magnitude. 

We use (Polychord)[https://github.com/PolyChord/PolyChordLite] and (Anesthetic)[https://github.com/williamjameshandley/anesthetic] for our analysis.
